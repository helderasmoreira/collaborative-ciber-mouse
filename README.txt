Collaborative Ciber Mouse - Assignment 4

O.S: Linux (Ubuntu)

Directory organization:
collaborativeRobot - directory for the Java implementation of the ciber mouse robot
simulator - directory for the simulator
Viewer - directory for the viewer

To start the simulation, run the script "start" in the home folder with the command:

sh start

This will create an instance of the simulator, one of the viewer, and five mouses.
They will be automatically connected to the simulator, and their individual visualizers will also be initialized.
Keep in mind that before doing this, you need to compile the robot client, using the instructions below.

To compile the robot client, run the make file with the following command:
--TODO
